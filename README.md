## Introduction
A fast spirograph&reg; creation web page for touch-screen devices.
Since there is no animation the completed curve is displayed instantly.
The adjustable parameters are not in confusing
mathematical terms, but are instead modeled after the classic spirograph
toy, in terms of "teeth" of the ring and gear.
