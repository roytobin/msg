<h3> Repeat Count & Teeth Skip </h3>

<p>
These two parameters go together.  Increasing Repeat Count
creates more curves.  Repeat Count=0 means only one curve.  Repeat Count=1
means one additional curve (two curves total).  Increasing Teeth Skip
creates more space or gap between each curve.  Teeth Skip=0 means all
curves are atop each other and so only the last one shows.

<h3> Penhole Offset </h3>

The location of the penhole where the artist inserts the drawing pen
on the moving gear.  The value represents the offset expressed as a
<b>percentage</b> from the center toward the edge.  A value of 0 is the
center of the gear, and the resulting curve is a circle.  A value of
100 is the edge of the gear, and the resulting curve is a hypocycloid.
Negatives are allowed.  Try -63  63 with two complementary colors.
</div>

<div class="beige">
<h3> Pen Thickness </h3>

The thickness (or darkness or boldness) of the curve to be drawn.  Decimal
point is allowed.  Value 0.2 is a very fine line, 1.0 average, 3.0 bold.
</div>

<h3> List Notation </h3>

Many parameters can accept a list of multiple numbers.  A list is a
space-separated list of numbers.  Most numbers are in terms of teeth.
But remember, Penhole Offset is an offset <b>percentage</b>; this is
the only parameter that is expressed as a percent.

<h3> Sequence Notation </h3>

A sequence notation is available to concisely express a list of numbers.
For example, the notation 63..49x33 is expanded to a list of 33 decimal
numbers evenly spaced from 63.0 to 49.0.  For example, 0..5x6 expands to
six numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5.  To create a mandala drawing, use Penhole Offset
63..23x17 for example.  Nice pinwheel looking curves can be drawn when the
repeat factor of Penhole Offset equals the repeat factor of Start Tooth.

<h3> Color (manual) </h3>

<p>
If you are using Firefox on Android, you will need to install a better
color picker because the native one only presents a few fixed colors.
To enter colors manually, use "web hex color" notation.
Check your alma mater site to see the official hexadecimal values of
your school colors.  For example, #003262 #fdb515
<span id="go"> Go </span>
<span id="be"> Bears! </span>
</p>

<h3> Color Rainbow </h3>

Search "hsl web color" for an overview.  To express a rainbow of many
colors use sequence notation.  For example, the notation hsl( 0..359,
88%, 77% ) x17 expands to a list of 17 different colors sweeping across
the full spectrum.  For convenience, you may enter just the numbers and
dots of hsl sequence notation.  For example, 0..359 88 77 x21 sweeps hue
(color) across the full spectrum in twenty one increments.  Even the
little 'x' is optional.  The software will automatically fill in the
rest for you.

<h3> Color Fade </h3>

Same as rainbow, except the lightness parameter of the hsl notation
varies.  For example, hsl( 41, 88%, 9..81% ) x21 represents twenty one
shades of orange (hue=41) from deep orange to almost white.  Again, all
characters except the numbers and dots are optional, so don't fret
if you accidentally erase a character.  The software will automatically
fill in the rest for you.
</div>

<h3> Interesting </h3>

<p>
The gear may have <b>more</b> teeth than the ring.  In the physical world,
this situation is impossible.  But the math works out just fine.  Try Ring
Teeth=105 and Gear Teeth=109 for example.  Watch what happens when the
number of gear teeth equals, then exceeds, the number of ring teeth.
Please use Autoscale if the image gets zoomed too much or too little.
</p>

<p>
The Penhole Offset may be <b>greater</b> than 100%, meaning outside the
edge of the moving gear.  Impossible in the physical world, but the math
still works.  Try it, adjusting Autoscale to taste.
</p>

<p>
When the Gear Teeth and Ring Teeth are small numbers, the drawing becomes
very angular and jagged.  Try ring/gear of 11/7 or 11/13.  At larger
teeth values, all the little line segments are so close together they
appear to form a smooth curve.  This illusion is revealed using small
Ring and Gear Teeth values.
</p>

<p>
Try very fine Pen Thickness (eg 0.3) in conjunction with sequences
with many, many numbers.  One can get produce curious interference
patterns.
